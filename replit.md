# Overview

This is a static personal portfolio website built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project is designed to showcase professional experience, skills, and work to recruiters, hiring managers, and potential collaborators. The site follows a minimal, mobile-first approach with four main pages: Home, About, Work, and Contact. It's optimized for quick scanning by recruiters (30-60 second attention span) while providing deeper content for peers and collaborators who want to explore case studies and technical skills.
